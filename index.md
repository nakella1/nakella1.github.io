### CPSC 120
Lab 1


Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs in this course because it was the first time I was able to experience coding in real world situation. By using visual studio I was able to clone repositories and learn basic coding commands such as std: cout. This lab gave me a teaser to what is to come in future projects.


 Lab 4
Lab 4 was another lab I enjoyed working on as it related to Lab 2 and helped me understand the basis of edit-compile-run-test-release cycle. It was my first time using the black box testing to check that my code was bug-free and create commands from scratch.


Lab 7
Lab 7 was by far my favorite out of all the labs because I grew up playing and till this day play blackjack with my friends. Was able to learn new commands like stdierr which returns errors and use defensive programming to write a program that validates command line input, and prints a command error when an input is invalid.
